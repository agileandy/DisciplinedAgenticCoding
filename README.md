# DisciplinedAgenticCoding

v4 of my evolving Agentic Coding Framework

## Important
The DAC-Framework.md is the definitive guide and should take precendence. 

The included role and artefact prompts should be considered as examples only - DAC is principles based framework, while the included prompts contain explicity refence to direct practices that are relevent at the moment. Furthermore these prompt are generic in nature - user specific prompts should contain information about the specifics users context.

**However** - the whole reposity is useful as a starting point for someone adopting agentic coding, and these generic prompts should help ensure improved outcomes compared to a pure _vibe_ coding based approach
