# Active Development Log: [Project Name]

This document is the canonical log of all development activities, decisions, and outcomes for the project. **New entries are always added to the top of the "Development Log" section.**

## 1. Current State Dashboard

_[This section provides a quick, at-a-glance summary of the project. It is derived from the detailed log below.]_

**Current Sprint Goal:** [Goal for the current iteration.]

**In Progress:**
*   `TASK-002`: Implement user login endpoint.

**Next Up:**

### **LOG ENTRY: 2025-08-27**
**Type:** Task Update
**ID:** `TASK-002`
**Status:** `IN_PROGRESS` → `NEEDS_REVIEW`
**Author:** Coder Agent

**Summary:** The initial implementation for the user login endpoint is complete and all defined tests are passing. Ready for code review.

**Commits:**
*   `[commit_hash_1]`: feat: Add POST /login endpoint structure
*   `[commit_hash_2]`: test: Add unit tests for password hashing
*   `[commit_hash_3]`: feat: Implement JWT token generation

### **LOG ENTRY: 2025-08-26**
**Type:** Issue Logged
**ID:** `ISSUE-001`
**Status:** `OPEN`
**Author:** Architect Agent

**Summary:** While designing the integration for [External Service], I realized we don't have clear information on their API rate limits. This blocks the final design of the data sync component.

**Action Item:** Orchestrator to contact the service provider. Coder should not start work on `TASK-004` (Data Sync) until this is resolved.

### **LOG ENTRY: 2025-08-25**
**Type:** New Task Started
**ID:** `TASK-002`
**Status:** `PLANNED` → `IN_PROGRESS`
**Author:** Coder Agent

**Summary:** Starting implementation of the user login endpoint.

**Implementation Notes:**
*   Will use the Argon2 algorithm for password hashing as specified in `systemDesign.md`.
*   JWT tokens will have a 15-minute expiry.

### **LOG ENTRY: 2025-08-24**
**Type:** New Task Defined
**ID:** `TASK-002`
**Status:** `PLANNED`
**Author:** Orchestrator Agent

**Summary:** Implement user login endpoint.
**Linked Requirement:** `projectContext.md` → Epic 1 → "As a Data Analyst, I want to be able to log in securely..."

**Acceptance Criteria / Test Scenarios (from Tester Agent):**
*   **Given** a registered user with valid credentials
    *   **When** they submit a POST request to `/login`
    *   **Then** the system should return a `200 OK` status and a valid JWT token.
*   **Given** a user with an incorrect password
    *   **When** they submit a POST request to `/login`
    *   **Then** the system should return a `401 Unauthorized` status.
*   **Given** a non-existent user
    *   **When** they submit a POST request to `/login`
    *   **Then** the system should return a `401 Unauthorized` status.

**Architectural Guidance (from Architect Agent):**
*   Ensure the password hashing logic is in an isolated utility function to promote reusability and testability. Do not perform hashing directly in the request handler.
