*   **Epic 1: [e.g., User Authentication]**
    *   **Story:** As a **Data Analyst**, I want to be able to log in securely with my username and password, so that I can access my personalized dashboard.
    *   **Story:** As an **Administrator**, I want to be able to reset a user's password, so that I can help them if they are locked out.
